### Welcome! I'm Jessica 👋

- I live in England 🌍
- I am a scorpio ♏
- My pronouns are she/her ♀️   

#### A little bit about me:  
🌱 I'm currently learning JavaScript  
💻 I want to be a developer because I enjoy the ability to be both technical and creative 🖌️  
🧵 A couple of my hobbies are sewing and gaming 🎮  
✈️ My biggest goal is to travel and see as much of the world as I can  
👩‍🚀 If I didn't want to be a developer I'd love to be an astronaut or an ocean conservationist 🤿
